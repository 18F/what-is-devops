### Configuration management:

Changing the configuration of any asset should be under total management and done through automated tools that leave an audit trail. This includes your entire environment - it should be entirely represetned as infrastructure as code (IaC). Use the open source versions before the paid enterprise versions.

Examples are:

* [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home)
* [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/)
* [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/)
* [Salt](http://saltstack.com/)
